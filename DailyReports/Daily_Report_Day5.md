## Activities:
- Implemented **RetryAnalyzer.java** and **RetryTransformer.java** for TestNG to enable automatic retry of failed tests.
- Updated **testng.xml** to include:
    - `RetryTransformer` listener for automatic retry.
    - Standard `EmailableReporter2` for HTML reporting.
- Developed **ScreenshotUtil.java**:
    - Captures screenshots on test failure with timestamp.
    - Saves screenshots locally under `target/screenshots/`.
    - Returns byte array for Cucumber attach.
- Integrated **ExtentReports**:
    - Added `ExtentManager.java` (singleton ExtentReports instance).
    - Added `ExtentTestManager.java` to manage ExtentTest instances per thread.
    - Updated **Hooks.java** to start/end Extent tests and embed screenshots.
- Added **GitHub Actions CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
    - Runs Maven tests on Chrome (Ubuntu).
    - Archives `extent-report.html` and screenshots as artifacts.
- Wrote **README.md**, **Final Report**, and **Final Test Execution Report** to finalize project documentation.
- **Project completed**: all features, utilities, reporting, and CI setup finalized.
