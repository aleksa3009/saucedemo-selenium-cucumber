- Implemented **BaseTest** class with WebDriver setup/teardown.
- Added **DriverFactory** for browser selection (Chrome/Firefox) and properties configuration.
- Created **config.properties** and **log4j2.xml** for environment and logging settings.
- Developed multiple **utility classes**:
    - `ScreenshotUtil.java` for automatic screenshot capture on failures.
    - `ConfigReader.java` for reading config properties.
    - `LoggerUtil.java` for Log4j2 logging integration.
- Implemented **SmokeTest**:
    - Validated home page title "Swag Labs".
    - Verified login flow with fixed user credentials.
    - Added detailed input comments in the test code for readability.
- Added **TestNG suite file** (`testng.xml`) to allow Maven execution of all or specific tests.
- Updated `.gitignore`:
    - Ignored `target/`, logs, IntelliJ-specific files except essential project files.
- Committed all utilities, BaseTest, SmokeTest, TestNG configuration, and `.gitignore` updates with descriptive commit message.
- Verified local Maven build and test execution:
    - `mvn -Dbrowser=chrome clean test` ran successfully with SmokeTest passing.
